Let's see... I'm interested in programming best practices and technical management...

... embedded C/C++, Python, Django... wireless sensor networking (ZigBeef) and battery life...

Mobile App Programming (iOS and Android)...

Amazon Web Services...

## Real Time embedded time-budgeting !! Rate monotonic analysis (RMA) as applied to embedded systems...

Intriqued by the quick prototyping of the Raspberry Pi and the Beaglebone (like everyone else.)

And... I've got four degrees (from both state and private universities) and a couple of technical certifications (Cisco CCNA expired and Solidworks CWSA) for fun.
